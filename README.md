# SF-Bay-Commute-Prediction

This project presents a machine learning approach to predicting the commute time of
individual San Francisco Bay Area workers around the year 1990 utilising numerous identifying
features of their daily drive. Tech companies Google and Apple have solved the challenge of trip
time prediction through machine learning methods paired with comprehensive real-time data to
provide their users with accurate trip time estimates. Having insight into commute length allows for
optimal schedule planning and aids an employee in choosing how far away from home they should
work. Offering a precise trip time prediction software to the public is an incredible product, and is
one of the most widely consumed products of machine learning today.
